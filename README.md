# Data-Analysis-using-SQL

SQL is a conceptual language for working with data stored in databases. In this case, we will be implementing SQLite. 
Most SQL languges share all of the capabilities in this document. The differences are usually in performance and advances analytical funcionalities (and pricing of course). 
Eventually, we will use SQL lunguage to write queries that would manipulate data from the DataBase.

The most important component of the DB is its tables - that's where all the data stored. 
Usually the data would be devided to many tables, and not stored all in one place (so designing the data stracture properly is very important). 
Most of the scripts in this karnel would handle how to work with tables.

I use the database from Kaggle's [European's Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) dataset for this demonstration.
